#include <iostream> //include the libraries we'll use
                    //a pre-processor directive
                    //<iostream> is a part of the C++ standard library
                    //contains objects and functions to print text to the screen 
                    //and to receive text from the keyboard
                    //preprocessor directives do not end with a semicolon

int main(){         //main entry point of our programme,
                    //a function that is executed by default
                    //'main' function must return an integer denoted by 
                    //the 'int' keyword
                    //eg. int <name of the function> <list of parameters>
                    //the main function may receive either nothing or a set of strings
                    //that come from the command line,
                    //just the way you run command with arguments.
                    //In this case, we'll use an empty list of parameters
                    //which is enclosed by parentheses.

//The body of the function is a block of code and blocks are delimited by curly brackets, symbolizing the beginning and end of the block.
